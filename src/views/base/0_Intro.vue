    <p class="ps">*** This repo is a live template, ready to get feeded by your project content. It was mainly design to produce and present documentation in a fast manner. Duplicate the repo, own the code, and start your producction.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="ps">*** You can test the system live right now by following the workflow: <br>1.Style (The global variable style system) <br> 2.Components (The documented library) <br> 3. EditMode (Toggle a development environment) <br> 4.Create (Manual or with AI) </p>
    <br>
    <p class="ps">*** Its presented as live documentation to explain it self, but also to define the interpretation of the AI over the system when producing or formating the contnt feeded.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="ps">*** The system consists of basic features that consider the complexities of UX/UI desing and frontend development: <br> - A vue component library build on top of a generic style variable system to mantain consistency and alignment in a global way. <br> - An Edit mode that can be toggled on and off to hide the base views that lets the user edit the environment. <br> - A Navegation system that lets you create views and automates their route mapping. <br> - AI that helps you create view pages, by formating your content based on the systems library documentation ( UseCase/ )</p>
    <br>
    <p class="ps">*** The system is designed in a strict manner. It is not intended to be infinitly costumizable, insted desicions where made to make this live template well suted for the constrains that define it: "Produce and present documentation in a fast manner" </p>
    <p class="ps">*** The filosofy of the constrains:  If you want to cut a tree, you use a Chainsaw. If you want to cut a paper you use Scissors. We dont design a single tool that cuts Trees and Papers. We create stuff convinient for the situation; we can say its "Designed by its Constrains". Of course the Scissors can be used in some creative way to do something else, but its design is shaped by its purpose.</p>
