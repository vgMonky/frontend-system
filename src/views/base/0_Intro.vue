    <p>*** Start your own documentation-web now. This repo is a template, ready to get feeded by your project documentation. By creating Documentation you are automating communication for the team or organization.</p>
    <br>
    <p>*** Follow the workflow. You can test the system live right now: <br>1.Style (The global variable style system) <br> 2.Components (The documented library) <br> 3. EditMode (Toggle a development environment) <br> 4.Create (Manual or with AI) </p>
    <br>
    <p>*** Its presented as live documentation to explain it self. The system lets you visualize, customize and use a vue component library build on top of a generic style variable system.</p>
    <br>
    <p>*** The system is designed in a strict manner. It is not intended to be infinitly costumizable, insted desicions where made to make this live template well suted for the constrains that documentation-web development can brings to us.</p>
    <p>*** The filosofy of the constrains:  If you want to cut a tree, you use a Chainsaw. If you want to cut a paper you use Scissors. We dont design a single tool that cuts Trees and Papers. We create stuff convinient for the situation, we can call them: "The Constrains". Of course the Scissors can be used in some creative way to do something else, but its design is shaped by its purpose.</p>
