# FrontEnd System

An organiced starting point for developing a website based on a feature modules structure.

Main modules right now are in `core_modules/`:

- Navigation: A navigation system that includes "view", "navbar" and "menu". It sets menu items and their routing in an automatic way.
- StyleVariables: A way to control and use css variables. Every UI component should be created based on these style variables.
- UseCase: A way to display components, their src code, and some informative description.
- FreeComponents: Contains basic generic components for a website.
