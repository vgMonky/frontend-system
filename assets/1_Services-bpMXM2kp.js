Recommended AI Usage</h4><p data-v-3300252f>While AI assistance is a powerful feature, it&#39;s important to maintain human oversight. We recommend providing the AI with clear content direction and specifications. This can be in various formats such as bullet points, tree structures, paragraphs, or detailed specifications. Remember, the user retains creative control, with the AI serving as a responsive tool to enhance productivity.</p></section></main>',1))]))}},h=n(p,[["__scopeId","data-v-3300252f"]]);export{h as default};
