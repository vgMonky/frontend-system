They are random ideas and not concrete explenations. <br><br><br><p class="ps">*** The filosofy of the constraints: If you want to cut a paper you use Scissors. If you want to cut a tree, you use a Chainsaw. We dont design a single tool that cuts Trees and Papers. We create stuff convinient for the situation; we can say its &quot;Designed by its Constraints&quot;. Of course the Scissors can be used in some creative way to do something else, but its design is shaped by its purpose.</p><br><p class="ps">The system is designed in a strict manner. It is not intended to be infinitly costumizable, insted desicions where made to make this live template well suted for the constrains that define it: &quot;Present content in a fast manner, with professional UX/UI standard&quot;. It lets the user create pages automatically by prompting over the system and controling global variables. It also has a secundary mission, which is to serve as a base template for developers to extend functionalities. </p><br><br><p class="ps">*** You can test the system live right now by following the straight forward workflow: <br> 1.Style (The global variable style system) <br> 2.UseCase (The documented library) <br> 4.EditMode (Toggle a development environment) <br> 5.Create </p><br><br><p class="ps">*** For Developers: This repo is a live template, a factory ready to produce and present content, but also a system-base redy to get feeded by your own components. Duplicate the repo, own the code, and start your extension.</p><br><p class="ps">*** Its presented as live documentation to explain it self to humans, but also to define the interpretation of the AI over the system.</p><p class="ps">The AI knows all &quot;Use Cases&quot; precented in the documentation. Changing the documentation will make the AI interprete the system diferently, and by end format the content diferently. The style is mantained globaly and can be edited manualy in the &quot;Style&quot; page.</p><br><p class="ps">*** The system consists of basic features that consider the complexities of UX/UI desing and frontend development: <br> - A vue component library build on top of a generic style variable system to mantain consistency and alignment in a global way. <br> - An Edit mode that can be toggled on and off to hide the base views that lets the user edit the environment. <br> - A Navegation system that lets you create views and automates their route mapping. <br> - AI that helps you create view pages, by formating your content based on the systems library documentation ( UseCase/ )</p><br><br><p class="ps">*** Recomendation: The AI is not the boss, at list not yet. We recomend you give him the content and direction, it can be bullet points, tree structure, paragraphs, vocabulary descriptions, detailed specifications... whatever format you want. Just remember you are the boss and he reacts to your prompt.</p>',23)]))}const d=t(n,[["render",r]]);export{d as default};
